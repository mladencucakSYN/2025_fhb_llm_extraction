# Archive of Old Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks from the original project structure that have been superseded by the new numbered notebook system.

## Archived Files

### 00_test_gemini_setup.Rmd
- **Status**: Superseded by `0010_test_gemini_api.Rmd`
- **Reason**: New version has better documentation following notebook-developer.md standards
- **Date Archived**: 2025-11-03
- **Content**: Basic Gemini API testing
- **Preserved for**: Reference, comparison with new version

### 01_getting_started.Rmd
- **Status**: Content redistributed to multiple notebooks
- **Reason**: Split into focused notebooks for better learning progression
- **Date Archived**: 2025-11-03
- **Content Moved To**:
  - Toy examples → `0020_toy_example_extraction.Rmd`
  - Rule-based extraction → Referenced in multiple notebooks
  - Evaluation examples → `0500_quality_assessment.Rmd`
- **Preserved for**: Reference for original structure

## Why Archive?

The project was restructured on 2025-11-03 to:
1. Combine educational toy examples with student's real Fusarium research
2. Follow notebook-developer.md documentation standards
3. Create a logical progression from simple to complex
4. Add comprehensive error handling and production-scale processing
5. Integrate LDA topic modeling workflow
6. Provide complete analysis pipeline

## New Notebook Structure

The new structure follows this progression:

- **Section 0 (0000-0030)**: Setup and educational foundation
- **Section 1 (0100-0120)**: Fusarium data loading and preprocessing
- **Section 2 (0200-0230)**: Topic modeling for data reduction
- **Section 3 (0300-0330)**: LLM extraction development
- **Section 4 (0400-0430)**: Production-scale processing
- **Section 5 (0500-0530)**: Validation and research analysis

See main README.md for complete documentation.

## Can These Be Deleted?

No, keep these files for:
- Historical reference
- Comparison with new approach
- Understanding design decisions
- Recovery if needed

## Using Archived Notebooks

These notebooks may not work with the current project structure. If you need their functionality:
1. Review the content
2. Find the equivalent in the new numbered notebooks
3. Use the new version which has improvements and follows current standards
